First of all, my name is Faisal Ghali, and I am the owner and founder of Nomads Coffee.
I started Nomads Coffee because of a passion that I had for coffee and its rich tradition in my culture,
in Middle Eastern culture. And basically I realized that coffee in North America was perceived as --
usually is perceived as a quick grab-and-go thing in the morning, and there's not much celebration around it.
Whereas, where I come from, coffee is more ceremonial, and it's celebrated and it's often used as a the chosen beverage for social gatherings,
mainly because alcohol is not consumed in that part of the world.
So basically, I wanted to bring that part of my culture and passion here to Ottawa, and decided to create the proof of concept or pop up coffee shop,
where I started off by inviting my friends and family, and I shared my coffee and the different twists that I had on the coffee with them, and they all loved it, and so yeah.
That led Me to doing a pop up at the Italian festival and sharing it with the community, rather than just my friends and family.
And again, I got positive feedback, positive reviews, which led me to my connection with the urban art collective in Hintonburg.
So that's where I thrived. I kind of had, like some sort of residency at the urban art collective, which is kind of a gallery and a market at the same time.
So yeah, I did my pop up, or my coffee shop. I ran it from the urban art collective, and it was a success, and people loved it.
I also loved the neighborhood of Hintonburg. It was vibrant. It's still vibrant. Had a lot of culture and art. Loved the people from the neighborhood, very, very supportive.
And yeah, so that's the story of Nomads Coffee.
